CUST_ENVMAP:1 ; Set custom EnvMap sprite.>>Syntax: Customize=CUST_ENVMAP, EnvMapID, ObjectSlot, TENVMAP_, SpriteSlot, SpriteIndex, OcbCode, RoomNumber, MeshArray>>Sets individual EnvMap sprites per object or per mesh.>>Note: Custom sprites should have a size of 64x64 pixels. Anything above or below will not be rendered correctly!>>============>EnvMapID>============>Each command needs a unique ID. One object slot can have multiple CUST_ENVMAPs assigned. This is useful if you want to assign multiple different sprites to one object slot.>>============>ObjectSlot>============>The object slot that you want to change. For a full list see "Movable slot indices" in the Reference Browser.>>============>TENVMAP_>============>Set one of the EnvMap Flags. See the Reference Browser for a list of possible flags.>>============>SpriteSlot>============>Define the sprite slot that contains the sprite you want to use.>The sprite slots are DEFAULT_SPRITES, CUSTOM_SPRITES, MISC_SPRITES, and SKY_GRAPHICS.>Other slots may be used, but will probably crash the game if they contain no sprites.>>============>SpriteIndex>============>Determine which sprite to use.>The index is counted starting from 0. This matches the numbers displayed in WadTool.>>============>OcbCode>============>If you want to change the sprite based on a specific OCB code, type in the OCB code you want to use here.>If you don't want to use this feature, set it to IGNORE.>>Note: This doesn't change the behaviour of any existing OCB codes.>>============>RoomNumber>============>If you want to change the sprite based on a specific room, type in the room number here.>If you don't want to use this feature, set it to IGNORE.>>Note: This goes off the room numbers of the compiled level! Leaving gaps in your room list or activating certain TombEditor features might shuffle a level's rooms around.>>============>MeshArray>============>Set the meshes that you want to change.>>Example: Customize= CUST_ENVMAP, 7, BADDY_1, TENVMAP_MESH, DEFAULT_SPRITES, 19, IGNORE, IGNORE, 8, 23>This will change meshes 8 and 23 of BADDY_1 to sprite 19 of DEFAULT_SPRITES.
CUST_ENVMAP_GLOBAL:2 ; Set Global EnvMap.>>Syntax: Customize=CUST_ENVMAP_GLOBAL, SpriteSlot, SpriteIndex>>Sets the default EnvMap sprite for a level.>By default, the game will use sprite 11 in DEFAULT_SPRITES.>>Note: Custom sprites should have a size of 64x64 pixels. Anything above or below will not be rendered correctly!
